### Styling

The website needed to catch the users eye straight away and be dinosaur related, after doing various research on dinosaurs, most were located either on grass land, in water or jungles. I went for a jungle background to create a darker looking theme for the website with clear white writing.

The below colour scheme was used for the menus and text.
